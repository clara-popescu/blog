* At the beginning of week 4, I started thinking about how I could create something that really aligned with my thesis and how to communicate my idea clearly to the user.
* Since I was a bit stuck on the project concept, I decided to start my literature review, hoping that writing things out would help narrow down my options and clarify what my idea actually was.

* I realised I had been focusing too much on the word identity (in the psychological sense) which ended up taking a lot of time. What I actually needed to explore was digital identity. So I had to go back to doing more research. The good news was that this time I started finding papers and artworks that were much more relevant to my topic.

* I also worked on the MoSCoW method and it helped define the essential elements of my project.

* I read this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369365360_Set_of_use_cases_and_scenarios) and one of the authors mentioned that the word "person" originally meant "mask", referring to the masks actors would wear on stage (pg. 22). This idea fit perfectly with some of my other rough concepts, so I started sketching ideas that incorporated this mask element.
