At this point, I really had no idea what direction I wanted to take my final project in. There were so many topics I wanted to explore, and I wasnâ€™t sure how to narrow them down or choose just one. I was leaning slightly towards creating something artistic, but I was also open to a more scientific approach if it fit the concept better.
