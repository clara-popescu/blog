![Brainstorming image](/images/WEEK2.png)
* I brainstormed a couple of topics and did a bit of research for each of them: 
    1. interaction between computers and humans
    2. nature and computing 
    3. other random ideas

* I thought of previous assignments and realised I really liked data visualisation and physical computing, so I want to include some of that in my project. I realised I'm not a fan of biology so i decided to go with idea #1; there's a lot more to explore and research on this topic
* When I was taking a walk I thought of the topic of identities - in a personal sense but also how that interacts with our online identity.
* Started looking for academic text that I can use for my literature review and relevant artworks. Struggled a bit to stick to the topic and went down differnet rabbit holes.
