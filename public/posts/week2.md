* During week 2, I brainstormed a few potential topics and did some initial research for each of them: 
    1. interaction between computers and humans
    2. nature and computing 
    3. other random ideas

* Looking back at my previous assignments, I realised that I really enjoyed working with data visualisation and physical computing, so I wanted to include those elements in my project. I also realised that biology isn’t something I’m particularly interested in, so I decided to drop idea #2. The first idea felt the most promising, but I knew there was still a lot more to explore and research within that area.
* While out on a walk, I randomly thought about the topic of identities; both personal identity (what makes me who I am) and digital identity (how I present myself online)
* I started looking for academic texts and relevant artworks to use in my literature review. At first, I struggled to pin down a clear idea, which sent me down a few research rabbit holes. I ended up spending a lot of time reading psychology papers about how identities are formed. This was interesting, but probably only a small part of what my thesis will actually cover. After that, I decided to move on and refocus on other tasks.
